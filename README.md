## How it works
Google Meet's auto-generated captions are observed and parsed in realtime to keep a running count of characters used by each person.

The number of people used to calculate an equal share is based on those who have talked, not the number in the meeting. This is used because there can sometimes be non-active participants, or people that leave. While not perfect, this seems to yield the best result.
